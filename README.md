# Docx2MoodleXML
I wrote this script for a [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) based LMS platform I'm working on as a software dev at 
[ITI](https://www.iticsystems.com/). It converts docx files to XML format which can be imported into moodle as MCQs and 
True/False questions. 

At the time of writing this, the intention was to **_QUICKLY_** upload course content to the LMS. As a result, there might 
be a lot of room for improvement and optimization in this code. May return to this in the future to improve & build upon this.

## How it works
Place your docx file inside the `docx` directory and run `main.py`. The resulting file can be found inside the `xml` 
directory. These directories already contain example files to show case how the code works.
